"""Keyword-classify LQ crops into the 27 MC sections (no LLM required).

OCRs each whole page stack (cache tests/sections/lq/ocr_cache/<year>/qN.<w>x<h>.txt,
keyed by PNG size so a re-crop is re-read). Book 5 questions list every
radioactivity section they test (apply_book5_listings / classify_book5);
other books keep the single-primary scoring. Writes:
  tests/sections/lq/classification.csv
  tests/sections/lq/candidate_performance.json
  tests/sections/lq/<book>/<section>/ year-qN.png (+ optional answer copy)
  tests/sections/lq_classification.csv
  tests/sections/lq_classification.json
  metadata/lq/llm_classifications.json  (tracked classification decisions)

Top-level tests/sections/lq_classification.* is the split naming contract for LQ;
nested tests/sections/lq/classification.csv feeds build_lq_lavish_review.py.
--years merges into those existing nested/top-level rows and only replaces
section PNG copies for the selected years.
